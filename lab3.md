# Lab 3 Report
  This lab report is consist of three parts: 
  1. Creating a web server. 
  2. Example and discussion about bugs and symptoms. 
  3. A short conclusion about what I have learned during last two weeks. 

## Part 1: Web Server

   - This is my code for StringServer, the basic setup is really similar to the NumberServer we have seen before in the lab 2, the only difference is in the specific operation parts.
